# bash_setup

This repo is to make sure all my bash settings remain relatively the same across all devices.  I will continue to bulk it out as time passes.  The files should be named in intuitive manners.  Feel free to copy any of this or fork a copy of your own.  While I won't accept pull requests on this repo, if you see something incorrect, please point it out.  If you have a really great addition, note that as an issue too please.

I set this up to also reference a file not present in the repo: .bash_local
This file is meant to be unique to a device.  Want some things in Cygwin, or dedicated ssh aliases to frequently used remotes, I plan to put it in that file.
